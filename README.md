## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Emulator Not Found" Error
- Make sure BlueStacks is running before clicking Apply Bypass
- Check if HD-Player.exe process is active in Task Manager

- Try running as Administrator
- Check if the emulator is fully loaded before applying bypass

### Device Spoofing Not Working
- Install ADB and add to PATH
- Enable USB Debugging in BlueStacks settings
- Make sure BlueStacks is rooted
- Check bypass_log.txt for detailed error messages

### Still Getting Banned?
Free Fire uses multiple detection methods. For better protection:
1. Use a VPN
2. Don't use the same account on both mobile and emulator
3. Avoid using obvious cheats or mods
4. Apply bypass BEFORE starting Free Fire
5. Use Device Spoof feature for additional protection
